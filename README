---------------

NOTE 0: Perl 5 is required. Also is required the same C compilation
environment that was used to compile that Perl 5.

NOTE 1: If your operating system does not support these BSD functions,
Perl cannot help. In detailed terms: you _must_ have the C header file
<sys/resource.h> *). If you do not, this package is of little use to you.

NOTE 2: The header file alone is not enough: you must have library
support also. The C compiler include paths (-I...) and library paths
(-L...) and the attempted libraries (-l...) are listed in Makefile.PL.

NOTE 3: You cannot pass or receive 64-bit rlimits for setrlimit()
and getrlimit(). This is a limitation of Perl.

NOTE 4: More caveats (vendors' sloppy support for these things, et. al.)
in the Resource.pm inlined pod doc.

*) There is one exception to this on one platform. The terminally curious
   can find out where.
