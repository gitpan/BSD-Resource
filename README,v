This Perl extension implements the BSD process resource limit functions

	getrusage()	getrlimit()	setrlimit()

and the BSD process priority functions.

	getpriority()	setpriority()

NOTE 1: Perl 5 is required.

NOTE 2: if your operating system does not support these BSD functions,
Perl cannot help. In detailed terms: you _must_ have the C header file
<sys/resource.h>. If you do not, this package is of little use to you.

NOTE 3: The header file alone is not enough: you must have library
support also. The C compiler include paths (-I...) and library paths
(-L...) and the attempted libraries (-l...) are listed in Makefile.PL.

NOTE 4: More caveats (vendors sloppy support for these things, et. al.)
        in the Resource.pm inlined pod doc.

To compile

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

and to install

	make install

The documentation is the pod inlined into Resource.pm, use for example

	pod2man Resource.pm | nroff -man | more

to view the examples.

You can test how well the extension works with

	make test

Please report any bugs and/or missing/excess functionality to me.
Especially if your system does support these BSD functions but
the Makefile.PL fails to locate them, please let me know.

The platforms known to work are

	AIX 3.2.5
	AIX 4.1.1
	Digital UNIX 3.2C
	HP-UX 9.03
	IRIX 6.0.1
	SunOS 4.1.3
	SunOS 5.3
