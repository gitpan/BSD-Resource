	* Release 1.09.

	  Fixed to work with 5.6.0 and Solaris: the default setting
	  of Perl 5.6.0 is to use "large files", which does not mix with
	  the Solaris /procfs interface.  Workaround: use the old trusty
	  syscall().  The deficiency reported to Solaris kernel group,
	  so there's hope that in some future patch/release the procfs
	  will get fixed.

	  Document the "Your vendor has not ..." error message.

	* Release 1.08: (about time)

	  Fixed to work with 5.6.

	  Fixed to work with Linux (PRIO_ are just enums, not defines).

	  Added a few possible RLIMIT_ constants (RLIMIT_AIO_MEM,
	  RLIMIT_AIO_OP, RLIMIT_OFILE, RLIMIT_TCACHE).

	* Release 1.07:

    	  Major Solaris 5.[56] hackery to use the /proc.
	  Don't know whether older Solarises work anymore :-/
