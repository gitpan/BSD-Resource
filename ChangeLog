2010-03-14  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Address rt.cpan.org #53856: memory leak in get_rlimits()

	* Address rt.cpan.org #53859: clarify get_rlimits() docs
	
	* Release 1.2904.

2009-03-31  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Address rt.cpan.org #44082:
	  "Bug in compiler detection (Makefile.PL)" (for AIX xlc)
	  Patch submitted in the report by rehsack at cpan.org.
	
	* Release 1.2903.

2008-12-30  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Lowered the "0.95 of the current limit" down to
	  "0.75 of the current limit" in setrlimit.t so that
	  more memory-constrained systems (like 2MB or less of
	  default stack) have slightly more chance of completing the test.
	  The 0.75 also has more chance of aligning with page sizes.
	
	* The scalar context return of getrlimit() was documented
	  to return an object, even though it really returned the
	  soft limit, reported by anicka@suse.cz.  Fixed the documentation.
	
	* Judging by the cpantesters reports no netbsd has a functional
	  RLIMIT_STACK, so skipping the test in all of them.
	
	* Release 1.2902.

2008-01-29  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* netbsd-alpha does not have a functional RLIMIT_STACK,
	  reported by David Cantrell.  Skip the test, and document
	  as a known issue.
	
	* Release 1.2901.

2008-01-27  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Rewrite the setrlimit.t test.	 Simplify it a lot; now all
	  RLIM_INFINITY limits are simply skipped; for those that
	  are limited we try setting only the soft limit, and accept
	  a value lower than we tried to set, since various systems
	  might either enforce lower limits, or round up the limits.
	  Added documentation on setrlimit() about this.
	
	* Allow calling getrlimit/setrlimit and getpriority/setpriority
	  with the string names ("RLIMIT_NPROC", for example).

	* Include ppport.h (generated with perl 5.8.8), reshuffle
	  system header includes appropriately.

	* Tested also with older Perls, 5.005_05 and 5.6.2, in OS X.
	  (5.005_04 didn't work, it creates but then cannot dynaload
	   the .bundle files, go figure.)
	
	* Minor documentation tweaks and copyright year bumps.
	
	* Release 1.29.

2006-05-26  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Tweak the regexp parsing the ps -o output in setpriority.t,
	  from Alexey Tourbin and Rafael Garcia-Suarez.	 Still just
	  a best-effort attempt, but one can only try.

	* Release 1.28.

2006-05-25  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Address rt.cpan.org #13130 and #19412: try to cope with
	  an already reniced shell running the setpriority.t.  The
	  tricks used are trying "ps -o pid,nice" and looking for $$,
	  and if that fails, then trying whether the nice(1) is the
	  GNU one, and if so, running it without arguments.
	
	* Release 1.27.

2006-05-21  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Address rt.cpan.org #19298: bug in getrusage(): 'inblock' was
	  misspelt as 'inlock' (the end result being that people looking
	  for the 'inblock' field got zero)
	  
	* For Mac OS X reword the message about the RLIM_NPROC test failure
	  (or rather, the possible failure).  Still a mystery under what
	  exact conditions the test fails or succeeds.
	  
	* Add Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage tests.
	
	* Release 1.26.

2006-04-09  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Address rt.cpan.org #13131: setrlimit.t tries to increase hard
	  limits, cannot raise limits higher than the hard limit.

	* Address rt.cpan.org #13130: getpriority.t and setpriority.t
	  assume priority = 0, solution hopefully portable.  Now should
	  work under e.g. "nice make test".
	
	* Add more verbosity to the case of the known rlimit.t test
	  failure in Mac OS X.
	
	* Release 1.25.

Sun Feb 29 16:51:34 2004  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* No functional changes but document the known fact that
	  under at least Mac OS X 10.3.2 the t/setrlimit.t subtest #8
	  may fail because of an OS bug.  Also reorder the documentation
	  a bit to collect all the known issues under one heading.
	
	* Release 1.24.

Tue Oct	 7 21:54:04 2003  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Makefile.PL: use archlibexp instead of archlib in cc -I.../CORE
	  so that Perls installed under ~user work.

	* Release 1.23.

Sun Feb	 9 12:12:42 2003  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Add RLIMIT_LOCKS.

	* Fix a typo s/RLIM_SAVEWD_MAX/RLIMIT_SAVED_MAX/
	
	* Sort the @EXPORT list.
	
	* Release 1.22.

Thu Dec 12 01:15:44 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Patches for NCR MP-RAS from grommel@sears.com.
	
	* Release 1.21.

Tue Nov 26 04:20:38 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Add a warning about the time/load-sensitivity of the
	  tests to INSTALL and Makefile.PL.

	* Rewrite the getrusage.t and times.t tests a bit to
	  better work on a fast machine (IOW, try spending a
	  bit more time).

	* Release 1.20.

Fri Nov 22 17:57:44 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Fixed a test problem found by Alain Barbet: in NetBSD
	  the RLIMIT_STACK wants to be aligned.	 Fixed also the
	  other memory-related limit tests to allow for alignment.

	* Release 1.19.

Wed Nov 20 16:42:50 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Problem found by Jeff Boes, forwarded and analyzed
	  by Slaven Rezic: if one has a fast machine and/or
	  the granularity of times() is low, one could get false
	  negatives from far() in getrusage.t.	Fixed the same
	  problem in times.t.

	* Bumped the copyright statement years.

	* Release 1.18.

Thu Sep 19 16:53:26 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Patch from Miles Egan to use -I$archlib/CORE instead
	  of -I$installarchlib/CORE in Makefile.PL, since they
	  might be different but the first one is the one apps
	  are supposed to be using.

	* Sanity check for getrlimit/setrlimit/getpriority/setpriority
	  so that one won't use the string "RLIMIT_..."/"PRIO_..." when
	  one is supposed to be using the constant RLIMIT_.../PRIO_...

	* Release 1.17.

Sun Sep 15 18:44:36 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Patch from Allen Smith to avoid -lbsd in IRIX
	  since it potentially brings in harmful side effects
	  regarding setpgrp/setgroups.
		
	* Mention the use of VERBOSE in the probe failure message.
		
	* Release 1.16.

Thu May	 9 04:18:09 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Add COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE to Resource.pm.

	* Release 1.15.

Sat Jan 26 07:14:00 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* A space between the 2>/dev/null and the command is nice.

	* Release 1.14.

Tue Jan 22 16:55:44 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Alex J Avriette reported that in Darwin 5.2 the Makefile.PL
	  dies with great noise.  Simplify the resource header scan.
	
	* Release 1.13.

Wed Jan 16 02:38:54 2002  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.12.

	* Allen Smith had a compiler setup in IRIX 6.5 that made
	  Makefile.PL wrongly think that there be no <sys/resource.h>
	  ($ENV{CC} set to "cc -...", which made the basename() logic fail)

Fri Sep 28 05:35:16 2001  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.11.

	* I suck.  Vivek Khera reported NINE MONTHS ago that
	  I was missing sub isrss().  My memory was jogged by
	  a message from Jeff Boes ONE MONTH ago.  My apologies.

Mon Mar	 5 16:43:44 2001  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@alpha.hut.fi>

	* Release 1.10.

	* Move $VERSION from Makefile.PL to Resource.pm as suggested
	  by Philip Newton.

	* Require at least Perl 5.002.

Mon Oct 30 22:39:40 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.09.

	  Fixed to work with 5.6.0 and Solaris: the default setting
	  of Perl 5.6.0 is to use "large files", which does not mix with
	  the Solaris /procfs interface.  Workaround: use the old trusty
	  syscall().  The deficiency reported to Solaris kernel group,
	  so there's hope that in some future patch/release the procfs
	  will get fixed.

	  Document the "Your vendor has not ..." error message.

Sat Apr 15 23:45:06 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.08: (about time)

	  Fixed to work with 5.6.

	  Fixed to work with Linux (PRIO_ are just enums, not defines).

	  Added a few possible RLIMIT_ constants (RLIMIT_AIO_MEM,
	  RLIMIT_AIO_OP, RLIMIT_OFILE, RLIMIT_TCACHE).

Fri Jan 16 15:47:19 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.07:

	  Added pseudo-times().

	  Major Solaris 5.[56] hackery to use the /proc.
	  Don't know whether older Solarises work anymore :-/

Mon Jun	 2 13:32:54 1997  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.06:

	  Renamed release 1.05_02 to release 1.06 as the
	  release seems quite stable.

Sun Apr 27 18:20:00 1997  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.05_02:

	  Tiny cleanup work.

Sat Apr 26 21:10:00 1997  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.05_01:

	  More platforms known to work

		  MachTen 4.0.3		1)

	  Many thanks to

		Dominic Dunlop		<domo@slipper.ip.lu>


	1) well, setrlimit() does not, at all, but this is
	   a known bug in MachTen, Perl canna fix it...

Tue Apr 08 01:27:33 1997  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 1.05:

	  The platforms known to work
