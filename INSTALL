# INSTALL
#

To compile

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

and to install

	make install

The documentation is the pod inlined into Resource.pm, use for example

	pod2man Resource.pm | nroff -man | more

to view the examples.

You can test how well the extension works with

	make test

Please report any bugs and/or missing/excess functionality to me.
Especially if your system does support these BSD functions but
the Makefile.PL fails to locate them, please let me know.
Remember to send the outputs of 'perl -v' and 'uname -a' (or equivalent).

NOTE 1: The test t/getrusage.t is known to be tricky and to fail once
in a while. This is because the results depend on timing issues and
the activity of the operating system, it is moderately icky to
guestimate such tolerances that leave some slack while still proving
anything. Please retry 'make test' for a couple times, "eventually"
the test should pass. If even that fails, please see that the $debug
in the script is 1 and then run the test separately:

	perl -Mblib t/getrusage.t

or (if the above does not work)

	perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib t/getrusage.t

and send the results to me. Ditto for the other tests: running them
separately with the $debug on is useful for, well, debugging.

NOTE 2: The test t/getpriority may fail because in some systems the
login shell may have an initial priority that is not 0 or 19, the
usual values and this priority may be inherited by your Perl process
doing the testing. Please run the test like this

	perl -Mblib t/getpriority.t

or (if the above does not work)

	perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib t/getpriority.t

and report to me what it says and tell what kind of login you made.
(telnet, rlogin, slogin, klogin, ...?)
